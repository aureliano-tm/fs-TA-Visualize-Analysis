# Each branches means a version
# Standard Usage of the .ipynb File:
## 1. move the .ipynb file to the root directory of data folder
## 2. run the cell used for preprocess, it will output the processed files in the folder "Scans"
## 3. use surface xplorer to remove unwanted spectra, chirp correction, correct time zero, and crop data. output processed file to the root directory

## 4. clear all outputs and restart .ipynb (personal habit, it will be helpful to release computer resource)
## 5. reimport libraries, and start from the cells for visualize
## 6. enjoy
